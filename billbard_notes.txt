I’m thinking for my project, to look at the top 100 songs on the billboard and see why they were so popular.  
Going to look at demographics (age, race, etc.), new york times news of the time, and some other data.

Steps. 
1. Would need to go to the billboard website and scrap the data: https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100. 
2. Would need to go to the New York Times website and scrap the data: https://www.nytimes.com. 
3. Look into demographic data here:  https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=United%20States&tid=DECENNIALPLNAT2010.P1&hidePreview=false.
4. Complete data analytics 


Website.
1. Build out with a background image that changes every 5 to 10 seconds
2. Have a border on the top that says welcome.  Here it will also have the login button and a register button
3. Once user has registered and loggedin, they can type in their favorite song and it will return back a picture 
    of their song and a small audio sample and show it's billboard stats
4. I will also show the current week's top 25 songs
5. I will have another site where it will show my data analysis of the decades, that show how current 
    events and demographic data are influencing music top billboard stats
6.
